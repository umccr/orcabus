// TODO create a CDK Construct
//  that create AWS resources such as
//  aws_eventschemas.CfnRegistry  (this is L1) -- check whether we have L2 construct, etc..
//  then, create each schema and add into this registry

// TODO discussions:
//  1. CfnRegistry is stateful resource or, we create as part of self mutating pipeline?
//  2. then, we create these schema from JSON file more centrally into this registry
